# A shell script for automating the process of
# compiling and building a C program upon a change
# It accepts a C program along with
# the name of the binary file from the make
# or another compiler tool and finally
# try to execute the created binary file

# GNU stat is used to detect the file changes using
# "stat --format %Z FILE" which
# determines the time of last change of FILE
# as seconds since Epoch
